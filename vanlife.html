        <blockquote cite="https://kombilife.com/van-life/">
            The term “Van Life” represents more than just vehicle dwelling. It embodies a shift in the way people are 
            thinking, a movement that is sweeping across our generation’s mindset. Van Life is a sub-culture of nomadic 
            individuals embracing minimalism on a journey to reassess what is truly important for a happy and balanced 
            life. We have been conditioned to work all week, to pay for the house that we leave vacant all day and 
            the car that waits for us outside of our workplace. During our extremely limited time that isn’t spent 
            working, sleeping, commuting, and completing chores, we are supposed to carve out a life for ourselves, 
            if we have any energy left, that is. Van Dwelling offers us a growing community, an opportunity to reduce 
            our footprint, live more simply, and create a balanced lifestyle where experiences are given priority 
            over possessions.
